## 1. Regression

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. <br/> Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models:

Simple Linear Regression <br/>
Multiple Linear Regression <br/>
Polynomial Regression <br/>
Support Vector for Regression (SVR) <br/>
Decision Tree Classification <br/>
Random Forest Classification
